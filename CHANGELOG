# CHANGELOG

## 4.0.0

* Huge performance boost (almost 10 times faster when zooming or panning)
* Review configuration to get more intuitive naming
* Simplify tick format configuration passing only time formats instead of a whole function
* Fix zoom and panning center
* Better integration with module bundlers (allowing to pass a local D3 object instead of the global one)

We took profit of this major version change to improve the API without taking care of the previous one. See the [migration guide](./MIGRATION-4.0.md) for more informations.

## 3.0.0

Probably a lot of changes, but we didn't update the changelog at this time. :/

## 0.3.0

* API Change: The data for each event line object must now be in the `data` property (was `date`).
* Pass any data object to each drop and specify the date property with a callback.
* The SVG is now responsive and fit with its parent
* Rename `eventHover`, `eventClick` and `eventZoom` events to `mouseover`, `click` and `zoomend` respectively.
* Adding `mouseout` handler

## 0.2.0

* Display metaballs by default instead of simple dots
* Adding `eventClick` event handler on drops
* Use of Webpack instead of Babel for development tasks
* Full rewrite of the code base for better code splitting (may cause some BC breaks)
